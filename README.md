# RentAPet
Group Members: Brendan Capp, Eric Pierce, Daucen Osborn and Ariel Steele
The purpose of our project is to create a Rent-A-Pet application where you can reserve to spend the day with a pet, or even an exotic animal if you don't have the time to take care of a pet at home. All of us took on different tasks, and worked together to complete them. We were each assigned certain aspects of the application and we worked together and efficiently to complete the first sprint of the project. One special aspect of our project is the video that was added in.
