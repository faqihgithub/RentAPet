    <h1>Questions & Answers</h1>
    <li>Question 1) What is Rent-A-Pet?</li>
    <ul>Rent-A-Pet is an animal renting platform that will allow the user to rent any animal they wish(if it is available). The user(you) are not buying the animal</ul>
    <li>Question 2) Can i buy the animal if i like it?</li>
    <ul>Yes, you can if the owner allows the animal to be bought.</ul>
    <li>Question 3) What is the point of Rent-A-Pet?</li>
    <ul>Well, Rent a pet allows the user to spend time with an animal. This is almost like a demo. This will allow the user to see if they want to buy that type of animal. Lets say you want a dog and you can decide which dog you want, with rent a pet you can rent the dog(s). Then after a day of spending time with them you think that the dog is not really what you are looking for... Well now you are not stuck with a dog that you do not want. Rent a pet is also good when you want a pet but do not want to any of the care taking of it. You can play with the animal(s) and when it makes a mess you don't have to clean it up. The care taker(owner, trained personal, etc.) will do all the work for you.</ul>
    <li>Question 4) How much does rent a pet cost?</li>
    <ul>Rent a pet does not cost anything to sign up. If you want to rent a pet then you have to pay for the services that you want. The cost varies on depending on the animal.</ul>
    <li>Question 5) Where can we email you?</li>
    <ul>You can email us at RentAPet@dispostable.com !</ul>
